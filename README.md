## üéØ Project Overview

Forecasting solar power generation is a critical task for optimizing power grid management and promoting the adoption of renewable energy. This project aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model that forecasts the DC and AC power output of solar power plants using weather sensor data.

This end-to-end data science project demonstrates data integration, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models using Linear Regression, achieving an R¬≤ score of over 95%.

## üìä The Datasets

The analysis utilizes two types of data from two separate solar power plants in India:
1.  **Power Generation Data:** Time-series data of DC and AC power output, along with daily and total yield.
2.  **Weather Sensor Data:** Time-series data from plant-site sensors, including `AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE`, `MODULE_TEMPERATURE`, and `IRRADIATION`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Workflow

The project was executed through a systematic data science pipeline:

1.  **Data Integration & Cleaning:** The power generation and weather sensor datasets for each plant were loaded, cleaned, and merged based on the `DATE_TIME` key.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** New time-based features (`hour`, `minutes`) and a `temp_diff` feature (Module Temperature - Ambient Temperature) were created to enhance the model's predictive power.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed for high-level data exploration.
    -   Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) were used to visualize relationships between variables. A correlation heatmap confirmed that **Solar Irradiation** has the strongest linear relationship with power output.
4.  **Model Training:**
    -   **Linear Regression** was chosen as the modeling algorithm due to the strong linear correlation observed between the features and the target variables (`AC_POWER` and `DC_POWER`).
    -   Separate models were trained for each solar plant to account for plant-specific characteristics.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** The models were evaluated using the **R-squared ($R^2$) metric**, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## üèÜ Results & Key Insights

The Linear Regression models performed exceptionally well, explaining over **95%** of the variance in power generation.

| Plant   | Target Variable | R¬≤ Score |
| ------- | :-------------: | :------: |
| Plant 1 |    `AC_POWER`   |  95.5%   |
| Plant 1 |    `DC_POWER`   |  95.5%   |
| Plant 2 |    `AC_POWER`   |  96.4%   |
| Plant 2 |    `DC_POWER`   |  96.4%   |

The most significant insight from the EDA is that **Solar Irradiation is the primary driver of power generation**. The relationship is strongly linear, as shown in the plot below, which explains the high success of the Linear Regression model.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI for a comprehensive visual analysis of the solar plant data. It provides insights into power generation trends, the impact of weather conditions, and plant performance comparisons. The `.pbix` file is available in the `/dashboard` directory.
